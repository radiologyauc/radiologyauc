# Welcome 

We are a qualified Provider-Led Entity (qPLE) approved to provide appropriate
use criteria (AUC) under the Medicare Appropriate Use Criteria program for
advanced diagnostic imaging.

Our website will detail our efforts in bringing high-quality evidence-based
criteria for healthcare providers, researchers, and companies to use.

## Clinical Areas Covered

CMS has designated eight priority clinical areas, based on the
significance and the high prevalence of certain
diseases in the Medicare population.  

Our goal is to provide the most relevant criteria for these clinical areas


* Coronary artery disease (suspected or diagnosed)
* Suspected pulmonary embolism
* Headache (traumatic and non-traumatic)
* Hip pain
* Low back pain
* Shoulder pain (including suspected rotator cuff injury)
* Lung cancer (primary or metastatic, suspected or diagnosed)
* Cervical or neck pain
